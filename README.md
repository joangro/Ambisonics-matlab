REASONS:

Ambisonics it's a very interesting theory which revolves around codifying the soundfield using a complex and complete mathematical theory which has many interesting aplications and implications. 
As this theory has a lot of points from where it can be taken on, I want to try to implement this theoru into a series of the functional capabilities it's capable off, in a serie of distributed functions that work separately or together depending on our objectives.


OBJECTIVE:

Create and implement a list of basic functions to work with Ambisonics (Both standard and HOA) with Matlab.



FOLDERS:

  - Functions: Folder containing all the functions implemented
  
  
  

CURRENT FUNCTIONS:

(All the functions are localized on the functions folder)

-  	ambisonics-B-format:
    - Creates an ambisonic 4 channel track from an imput signal and directionality parameters.
    
-   ambis_a_b_converter
    - Converts an a-format ambisonic signal to b-format
