# ambisonics-B-format
Simple B-format coder based on Ambisonics. 

Function: It creates a 4-channel B-format from an input signal and Elevation/Opening information. The result
it's the signal with the directionality padding we have choosed.
If we choose more than one directionality, the result will be the original signal padded as many times as we
have chosen on the output signal.

NOTE: The input signal must be a MONOPHONIC signal.

-Script:
  The values of directionality must be placed on the vectors Azimuth and Elevation accordingly
  
-Core function:
  Creates the Ambisonic B-format from an input signal using Azimuth and Elevation values.
    
  - Input:    
    - signal: monophonic vector signal
    - Azimuth: Opening horizontal angle(X), can be a vector
    - Elevation: Median angle (Z), can be a vector
    - If Azimuth and elevation are vectors, they must be the same size

  - Output:   
    - y: monophonic B-format signal, if the inputs are vectors this will be the concatenation 
         of the same sound by the length of the vectors.
